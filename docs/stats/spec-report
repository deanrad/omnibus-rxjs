    Observable subscriptions
      ✓ can deliver events synchronously

  Bus
    ✓ can be instantiated with the BusItemType it will accept
    #query
      With a Predicate
        ✓ Returns an Observable of matching events
        ✓ Returns an Observable of filtered events
        ✓ is canceled by a reset
      With a raw value
        ✎ todo matches on equality of a value type
        ✎ todo matches on subset of an object type
      With an FSA matcher
        ✓ works just like a predicate
    #trigger
      ✓ puts an action on the bus
      ✓ Is not vulnerable to listener errors
    #triggerMap
      ✓ puts an action on the bus through a mapping function
